description: Ready to go templates to scaffolds projects with frameworks like Turborepo, NextJs and ReactJs.

Bootstrap your projects instantly. No more setup headaches - just pure development focus.

## The Origin Story

It all started with Turborepo. While it's powerful, the initial setup can be tedious. Your brilliant "Todo List" shouldn't wait for configuration files and folder structures. We believe your time is better spent building what matters.

## Our Solution

Instead of just creating another Turborepo template, we've built something better: a CLI that brings together all our favorite frameworks in one place. 

## Why Use Our Templates?

- **Zero Configuration**: No more setting up multiple folders
- **Framework Ready**: Your favorite frameworks, pre-configured
- **Instant Start**: Skip the boilerplate, start coding immediately
